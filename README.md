# derp_simulations

Derp is a cloud system agent that modelizes a user cluster behavior as three different Deep Q Learning Agents. <br/>
We have tested DERP in both simulations and real life environments. Here we present only the simulation environment. <br/>
The simulations environments (simple and complex) were provided to us by Konstantinos Lolos. <br/>
You can find the simple simulation in simple.py and the complex simulation in the complex.py. <br/>
We also provide a scaffold for building your own Deep Q learning agent, without the actual implementation <br/>
yes due to internal issues.

We have tested DERP and presented its efficiency here <br/>
[DERP: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Cloud System for Elastic Resource Provisioning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8590989) <br/>
In the above one can see DERP's architecture and the the 
DERP's agents networks architecture.<br/>
