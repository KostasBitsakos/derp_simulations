# derp_simulations
Derp is a cloud system agent that modelize a user cluster behaviour as three different Deep Q Learning Agents.
We have tested DERP in both simulations and real life environments.
Here we present only the simulation environment.
The simulations environments (simple and complex) were provided to us by Konstantinos Lolos.
You can find the simple simulation in simple.py and the complex simulation in the complex.py.
We also provide a scaffold for builindg your own Deep Q learning agent, without the actual implementation yes due to internal issues.

We have tested DERP and presented its efficiency here [DERP: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Cloud System for Elastic Resource Provisioning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8590989)
In the above one can see DERP's architecture and the the DERP's agents networks architecture.
