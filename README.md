# derp_simulations
Derp is a cloud system agent that modelise a user cluster behaviour as three different Deep Q Learning Agents.
We have tested DERP in both simulations and real life environments.
The simulations environments (simple and complex) were provided to us from Konstantinos Lolos.
You can find the simple simulation in simple.py and the complex simulation in the complex.py.

We have tested DERP and presented its efficiency here [link to Google!](http://google.com)
